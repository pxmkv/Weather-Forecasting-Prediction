# Weather Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Linear Regression to predict weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall in the Bay Area. Utilizing historical weather data from 2020 to 2022, the project aims to accurately forecast future weather patterns. The sequential and time-series nature of weather data makes it ideally suited for analysis using RNNs.
